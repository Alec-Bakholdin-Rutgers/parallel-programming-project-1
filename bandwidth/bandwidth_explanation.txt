In order to measure the memory bandwidth of our computer (tested on a virtual linux machine)
we generated a large 2D array then noted how long it took to perform operations that required
a load instruction on every element. Our program visits the first element of each row first
then moves on to the second element of each row and so on to avoid data reuse.
We then took the size of the matrix (in kilobytes) and divided it by the execution time to
obtain the memory bandwidth. This was done on matrices with dimensions of 1000x1000 up to 
11000x11000 which was the limit on the virtual machine. As the matrix grew, performance 
declined steadily but there were never any drastic decreases.
